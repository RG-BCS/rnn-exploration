# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset Using GRU Models

This project demonstrates sentiment classification on movie reviews using three types of GRU-basedarchitectures:

- **Custom GRU**: A manually implemented GRU cell and sentiment classifier  
- **Uni-directional GRU**: A PyTorch built-in GRU processing sequences left-to-right  
- **Bi-directional GRU**: A PyTorch built-in GRU capturing context in both directions  

These models are compared in terms of training speed, accuracy, and overall performance on the IMDBdataset.

## Motivation

Sentiment analysis is a fundamental natural language processing task that powers applications like
customer feedback interpretation, social media monitoring, and market research. While pre-built
models and libraries exist, implementing a custom GRU from scratch provides invaluable insights
into the mechanics of recurrent neural networks and deep learning workflows.

This project aims to deepen understanding by:

    . Building a tailored GRU cell and model without relying on high-level APIs
    . Demonstrating end-to-end pipeline: tokenization, vocabulary creation, batching, training, and evaluation
    . Applying the model to a real-world dataset (IMDB movie reviews) to classify sentiments
    . Showcasing practical skills in PyTorch, data processing, and visualization

By sharing this repo, the goal is to highlight hands-on expertise and a solid grasp of fundamental
deep learning concepts, making a strong case for joining any team focused on NLP or ML engineering.

## Project Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling in NLP. GRUs, a type of gated
RNN, balance model complexity and efficiency, mitigating vanishing gradients while capturing long-term dependencies.

This project aims to:

- Implement a custom GRU to deepen understanding of its inner workings  
- Leverage PyTorch’s optimized GRU implementations for improved performance  
- Analyze the impact of uni-directional vs. bi-directional architectures on sentiment classification accuracy  

---

## Dataset & Preprocessing

```bash
We use the IMDB movie review dataset, a benchmark for sentiment analysis tasks, with labels indicating
positive or negative sentiment.

Key preprocessing steps include:

- Tokenizing reviews and building a vocabulary  
- Mapping words to integer indices  
- Padding sequences in batches for uniform input length  

The data is loaded into PyTorch DataLoaders for training and validation.

## Conclusion

```bash
This project showcases the successful implementation of a custom GRU-based neural network for binary
sentiment classification on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. By building the GRU cell from scratch and
integrating it into a complete training pipeline, this project demonstrates::
    
    . A strong understanding of sequence modeling fundamentals
    . Competence in custom model design using PyTorch
    . Ability to process and batch real-world text data effectively
    . Skill in structuring reproducible, modular machine learning projects
    
- The **Custom GRU** provides a deep dive into GRU mechanics but suffers from slower training speeds.  
- The **Uni-directional GRU** offers an excellent balance of speed and accuracy, with rapid convergence and competitive validation performance.  
- The **Bi-directional GRU** achieves the highest validation accuracy by capturing information from both past and future contexts in the text, at a modest increase in training time.  
- This analysis demonstrates the trade-offs between custom implementation flexibility and framework-optimized architectures for practical NLP applications.

While pre-trained transformers like BERT lead in performance benchmarks, this handcrafted RNN approach offers unmatched
transparency, interpretability, and educational value. It’s especially well-suited for foundational learning, experimentation
in low-resource settings, and scenarios where model introspection is key.
